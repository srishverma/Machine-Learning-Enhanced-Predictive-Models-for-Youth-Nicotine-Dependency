Overview

This project explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) models to predict youth nicotine dependency by analyzing trends in e-cigarette, waterpipe (hookah), and novel tobacco product usage. Leveraging data from the 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), the study employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to identify critical social, mental, and environmental determinants of nicotine addiction.

Features

Dataset: 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS)

Algorithm Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Key Metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

Predictor Variables: 45 factors influencing youth nicotine dependency

Key Findings: Identification of significant predictors such as household e-cigarette exposure and personal perception of tobacco use

Objectives

Understand nicotine dependency among youth using ML techniques.

Identify critical predictors influencing nicotine addiction.

Develop predictive models to assist in prevention and intervention strategies.

Validate the model using robust statistical measures.

Data Source

The National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) 2022 dataset is a crucial resource for understanding tobacco use trends among U.S. middle and high school students. It includes data on:

Tobacco product use (e-cigarettes, hookahs, cigarettes, etc.)

Secondhand smoke exposure

Smoking cessation efforts

Accessibility of tobacco products

Attitudes and knowledge about tobacco

Influence of pro- and anti-tobacco media messages

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

Mode imputation for handling missing values.

Label encoding and normalization where required.

Feature Selection:

Identification of 45 predictor variables.

Model Implementation:

Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

10-fold cross-validation for model robustness.

Performance Evaluation:

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) used as an accuracy metric.

Results

The SVM model achieved an RMSE of 0.14, demonstrating high predictive accuracy.

Predictor variables aligned with previous research while also highlighting new insights.

Identified novel predictors such as household e-cigarette exposure and self-perception of tobacco use, crucial for awareness campaigns.

Impact and Applications

Public Health Campaigns: Insights can inform anti-nicotine initiatives targeting youth.

Policy Development: Findings can support regulations on youth tobacco access.

Cessation Programs: Models can help in tailoring intervention strategies for affected youth.
